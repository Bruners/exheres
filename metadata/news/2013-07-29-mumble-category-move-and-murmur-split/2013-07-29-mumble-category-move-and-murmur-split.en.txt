Mumble has been split in separate packages, the client voip/mumble in ::desktop
and the server voip/murmur in ::net. Please also review the murmur server setup
and that the owner of /var/{lib,log}/murmur is murmur:murmur. You may also want
to remove the old user and group named mumble-server from your system.

Please uninstall media-libs/mumble and install:

    * voip/mumble for the Mumble client
    * voip/murmur for the Murmur server
