With the bump to version 6.x the configuration of profile-sync-daemon underwent
major changes:

  1. A global systemd service is no longer used. Instead psd.service has to be
     started by each user separately as a user service (systemctl --user start
     psd.service).
  2. The global configuration file /etc/psd.conf is no longer used. Individual
     per-user configurations located at $HOME/.config/psd/psd.conf will be
     created on the first launch.
  3. Users wanting to use overlayfs MUST have sudo access (nopasswd) to the
     helper script /usr/host/bin/psd-overlay-helper.

Before upgrading to the new version the old, system-wide psd.service should be
stopped and disabled (since it will be removed). After the upgrade the old
configuration file /etc/psd.conf has to be removed or the user service will
fail to start.
